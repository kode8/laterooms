# Prerequisites

1. It's not mobile up (time permitted), desktop only. The page/components are not responsive. Usually I'd tackle this with mq mixins and, mobile up with mq embedded inside of classes
2. No feature detection, although I've left examples in the SCSS where I'd use a fallback ie. .no-flexbox 
3. There's no TDD, I've not done any TDD in js before (on my list)
4. There's no Redux, this is something I'm in the middle of learning 
5. I replaced most of build with my own webpack config, it contains postCSS plugins and a bunch of other stuff I find helpful 
6. I've not done a lot of React, apart from my own site http://johncarroll.surge.sh and this, that's about it
7. Would have loved to finish the autocomplete off with time
8. Hasn't been tested apart from Chrome
