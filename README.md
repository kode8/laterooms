# Prerequisites

1. No feature detection, although I've left examples in the SCSS where I'd use a fallback ie. .no-flexbox 
2. There's no TDD, I've not done any TDD in js before (on my list)
3. I replaced most of build with my own webpack config, it contains postCSS plugins and a bunch of other stuff I find helpful 
4. I've not done a lot of React, apart from my own site http://johncarroll.surge.sh and this, that's about it
5. Hasn't been tested apart from Chrome
6. Live version http://lrkata.surge.sh/

# Install 

1. git clone https://github.com/kode8/laterooms.git
2. cd laterooms
3. npm run install
4. npm run serve
5. http://localhost:8080
6. Chrome (hasn't been tested in other browsers)

Thanks!
